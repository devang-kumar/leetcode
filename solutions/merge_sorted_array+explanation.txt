Here's a clear explanation of the provided C++ solution for the "Merge Sorted Array" problem:

1. Approach/Algorithm used:
The solution uses a straightforward two-step approach:
- First, it copies all elements from nums2 into the empty slots of nums1 (which has extra space allocated for this purpose)
- Then, it sorts the entire nums1 array using the built-in sort function

2. Time Complexity: O((m+n) log(m+n))
- Copying elements from nums2 to nums1 takes O(n) time
- Sorting the combined array takes O((m+n) log(m+n)) time
- The overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step

3. Space Complexity: O(1) or O(log(m+n))
- The solution modifies nums1 in-place without using additional storage
- However, the sort function may use O(log(m+n)) space for its implementation (depending on the sorting algorithm used)

4. Key insights or techniques used:
- The solution leverages the fact that nums1 has enough space to accommodate all elements from nums2
- It uses the standard library's sort function to handle the merging after copying
- This approach is simple but not the most efficient for this specific problem

5. Brief walkthrough of how the solution works:
- The loop copies each element from nums2 (starting at index 0) into nums1 (starting at index m)
- After copying, nums1 contains all elements from both arrays, but they're not in sorted order
- The sort function then rearranges all elements in nums1 in ascending order
- The final result is a merged, sorted array stored in nums1

While this solution works correctly, it's worth noting that a more efficient O(m+n) time solution exists that merges the arrays in a single pass by comparing elements from the end of both arrays. The current solution is simpler but has higher time complexity due to the sorting step.
