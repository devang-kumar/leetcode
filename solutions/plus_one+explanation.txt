Here's a clear explanation of the provided C++ solution for the "Plus One" problem on LeetCode:

1. Approach/Algorithm used:
The solution uses a straightforward approach to increment a number represented as an array of digits by 1. It starts from the least significant digit (end of the array) and moves left. If a digit is 9, it sets it to 0 and continues to the next left digit (carry-over). If a digit is not 9, it simply increments it by 1 and returns the result. If all digits are 9, it inserts a new digit 1 at the beginning of the array.

2. Time Complexity: O(n)
In the worst case (when all digits are 9), the algorithm needs to traverse the entire array once, making it O(n) where n is the number of digits. The insert operation at the beginning is also O(n) in the worst case, but since it only happens once, the overall complexity remains O(n).

3. Space Complexity: O(1) or O(n)
The space complexity is O(1) in most cases since we're modifying the input array in-place. However, in the worst case (when we need to insert a new digit), it becomes O(n) because we're adding one more element to the array. Some might argue it's O(n) in all cases since the output array could be one element larger than the input.

4. Key insights or techniques used:
- The solution handles the carry-over operation efficiently by processing digits from right to left.
- It avoids unnecessary operations by returning immediately when a non-9 digit is found.
- The count variable tracks how many 9s were encountered, which helps determine if we need to add a new digit at the beginning.
- The solution modifies the input array in-place for efficiency.

5. Brief walkthrough of how the solution works:
- Start from the last digit (least significant digit).
- If the digit is 9, set it to 0 and increment the count (this represents a carry-over).
- If the digit is not 9, increment it by 1 and return the array immediately.
- If we reach the beginning of the array and all digits were 9 (count equals array length), insert a 1 at the beginning of the array.
- Return the modified array.

For example:
- Input [1,2,3] becomes [1,2,4] (no carry-over needed)
- Input [1,2,9] becomes [1,3,0] (carry-over from the last digit)
- Input [9,9,9] becomes [1,0,0,0] (all digits were 9, so we add a new digit)
