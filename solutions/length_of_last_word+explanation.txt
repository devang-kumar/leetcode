Here's a clear explanation of the provided C++ solution for the "length_of_last_word" problem:

1. Approach/Algorithm used:
The solution uses a two-pass approach to find the length of the last word in a string. First, it scans the string to find the starting position of the last word (the space before the last word). Then, it counts the characters from that position until the end of the string.

2. Time Complexity: O(n)
The algorithm makes two passes through the string in the worst case (one to find the starting position and another to count characters), so the time complexity is linear with respect to the input size.

3. Space Complexity: O(1)
The solution only uses a constant amount of extra space (a few integer variables), regardless of the input size.

4. Key insights or techniques used:
- The solution handles edge cases (like single-character strings) separately
- It looks for the pattern of a space followed by a non-space character to identify word boundaries
- The second loop only counts non-space characters to ensure we don't count trailing spaces

5. Brief walkthrough of how the solution works:
- First, it checks for the edge case where the string has only one character (and it's not a space)
- Then it scans the string to find the last occurrence where a space is followed by a non-space character (this marks the start of the last word)
- Finally, it counts all non-space characters from that position to the end of the string
- The count is returned as the length of the last word

The solution works by first identifying where the last word begins (after the last space that's followed by a non-space character), then counting all characters from that point onward that aren't spaces. This effectively gives the length of the last word while ignoring any trailing spaces.
